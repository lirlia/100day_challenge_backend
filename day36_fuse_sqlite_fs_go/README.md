# Day 36: FUSE SQLite Filesystem in Go

This project implements a userspace filesystem using FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) with Go. It uses a SQLite database as the backend storage for file and directory metadata and content.

## Features

- Mountable filesystem via FUSE.
- Stores filesystem structure and data in a SQLite DB (`db/dev.db`).
- Supports basic file/directory operations (create, read, write, delete, list, attributes).

## How to Build and Run

*Instructions will be added later.*
